Some Vim commands I learned to use myself. Most of them can be found in the links at the end of the article.
### Survive

- vi/vim -> open the editor
- :q -> Quit
- :wq -> Save and Quit
- :q! -> Quit and Not Save
- i -> Insert mode
- x -> Delete the char under the cursor
- dd -> Delete the current line
- pP -> Paste to above or under the current line
- yy -> Copy current line
- hjkl -> Right, Down, Up, Left

### Feel comfortable

- a -> Insert after the cursor
- oO -> Insert a new line after/before the current one
- 0 -> Go to the first column
- ^ -> go to the first non-blank character of the line
- $ -> go to the end of line
- g_ -> go to the last non-blank character of line
- /pattern -> search for pattern
- u -> undo
- `<C-r>` -> redo
- :e `<path/to/file>` -> open file
- bn,bp -> show next/previous file (buffer)

### Feel Better, Stronger, Faster

- . -> Repeat the last command
- `N<command>` -> Repeat the command N times.

- gg -> Go to first line
- G -> Go to last line
- b -> Open one buffer file
- % -> Go to the corresponding (, {, [.
- `*` -> go to next/previous(#) occurrence of the word under the cursor

### Vim Superpowers
