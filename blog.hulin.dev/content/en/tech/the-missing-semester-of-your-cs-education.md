Enrich Your Toolkit
<!--more-->

Recently, I came across a course: https://missing.csail.mit.edu/, which was shared by someone else. It doesn't teach you general theoretical knowledge of computer science, but rather a series of tools to increase your work efficiency. I already know most of them (haven't wasted these years, haha), but I still learned some useful things. In my opinion, the most notable ones this time are tldr[tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

There are also some I find interesting:
[feh](https://github.com/derf/feh): Command-line image viewer

[writegood](https://github.com/btford/write-good): English grammar checker

The course lists many tools. I think it's good to quickly go through the course, know that such things exist, and then come back to look at them when needed, before diving deeper. As I'm writing this, there are still two lessons I haven't seen, but I've finished the rest. Trust me, you'll definitely feel like you should have known this earlier after finishing it.
